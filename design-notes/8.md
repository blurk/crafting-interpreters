- A variable statement doesn’t just define a new variable, it can also be used to redefine an existing variable.
- A scope defines a region where a name maps to a certain entity. Multiple scopes enable the same name to refer to different things in different contexts.

- “Lexical” comes from the Greek “lexikos” which means “related to words”. When we use it in programming languages, it usually means a thing you can figure out from source code itself without having to execute anything.
